# Outdoor-Companion


## Description

This project is an outdoor entertainment companion. Outdoor companion checks the weather, displays a random generated quote and provides a playlist via Soundcloud based on the users mood and the length of time that they are completing an outdoor activity, such as walking, commuting to work, bike riding, etc.

## Installation

 The CSS, Javascript and images are located in the assets folder. This can be deployed on a web server, such as Github Pages.

## Usage

Upon page load, the user will input the city they are currently in, the type of music they'd like to listen to and the length of time that they will be on their outdoor journey. Once the user clicks submit, the display will change to show the weather, a 3 hour forecast so they will be able to monitor the weather before or during their outdoor activity, a random generated quote, and the playlist chosen for them. It is designed that the music will entertain the user for the entire time that they are on their journey.

The website can be launched by using GitHub pages, and follwing this URL:
